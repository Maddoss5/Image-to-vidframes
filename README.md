# Image-to-vidframes
Python code to input an image then create video frames of how the image was generated . Takes an image as input file and generates video frames on how that picture was generated from a whitepage . The number of vidframes = number of pixels that arent white so the number of vid frames might be very large ,hence why the image size used here is pretty small .
All the generated vidfframes are in the winrar file attached in the repository. 
Instead of using a list and distance function from a member in list to list you can also implement DFS .


# Further work 
1.> Overlap a hand texture on where the work is being done to make it more presentable . 

2.> Instead of coloring 1 pixel at a time you may do multiple pixels at a time .

Result is as shown -
